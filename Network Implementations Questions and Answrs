Q: PORT SECURITY ON AN ETHERNET SWITCH IS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE USE OF WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS?
A: Port-by port MAC addresssing- the switch can be set to allow only certain MAC addressing on a particular port, which helps prevent unathorized devices from connecting to the network.
Q: NAT OPERATES AT WHICH LAYER OF THE OSI MODEL?
A: Network, layer 3- since NAT works by modifying the IP address in packet headers as they pass through a router or firewall, thus allowing multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address when accessing external networks such as the internet.
Q: WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING CLI TOOLS CAN YOU USE TO CREATE AND MODIFY STATIC ROUTES ON UNIX OR LINUX SYSTEMS? 
A: ip (modern one), route
Q: IN AN IPV4 ROUTING TABLE, WHAT IS THE NETWORK DESTINATION ADDRESS FOR THE HOST SYSTEM'S DEFAULT ROUTE?
A: 0.0.0.0
Q: WHAT TYPE OF CABLE IS TYPICALLY USED TO CONNECT TO A ROUTER WITHIN A LAN?
A: Cat 5e or 6 cable-these cables support ethernet communication, which is essential for LAN connections
Q: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE VLAN?
A: To seperate broadcast domains w/in a single physical network-VLAN allows you to segment a single physical network ingto multiple logical networks, effectively creating seperate broadcast domains-this improves network efficiency by isolating traffic between different groups of devices
Q: WAT NETWORK TOPOLOGY CONNECTS ALL DEVICES TO A CENTRAL DEVICE SUCH AS A SWITCH OR A HUB?
A: Star- in this configuration each device communicates directly with the central device-simplifies network management
Q: WHAT IS A PROTOCOL THAT IDENTIFIES VLANS BY INSERTING A 32-BIT FIELD IN THE ETHERNET FRAME?
A: A: IEEE 802.1Q — This protocol adds a 32-bit tag into the Ethernet frame, allowing switches to identify which VLAN the frame belongs to. This enables VLAN-based segmentation and proper traffic management across trunk links.
Q: A SWITCH WITH AUTO MEDIU-DEPENDENT INTERFACE CROSSOVER (MDI-X) PORTS ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR WHAT?  
A: Crossover cables – MDI-X automatically detects the type of device connected and adjusts the transmit and receive pairs accordingly. This allows you to use straight-through Ethernet cables even when connecting similar devices (like switch-to-switch or PC-to-PC), where crossover cables were traditionally required.
Q: WHAT TASKS CAN YOU PERFORM TO SPLIT A SWITCHED LAN INTO MULTIPLE BROADCAST DOMAINS?
A: Install routers on the network & Create VLANS in the switch. 1.) Is good for connecting diferent networks, providing inter-VLAN routing, and applying security policies between networks. 2.) Is good for segmenting traffic logically (e.g., HR vs Finance vs IT), limiting broadcast traffic, & enhancing security & performance on large networks.
