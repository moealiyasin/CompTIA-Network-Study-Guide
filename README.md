## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This

As an IT Support Specialist sharpening my networking skills, I created this repo to:

- Document what Iâ€™ve learned while studying for certifications (e.g., CompTIA Network+, CCNA)
- Create a personal reference I can revisit and build on
- Share helpful, practical notes with others new to networking
